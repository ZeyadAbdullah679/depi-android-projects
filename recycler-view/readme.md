# RecyclerView Chat App Training Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice using RecyclerView in Android development. You will build a simple chat app interface that mimics a messaging application. While this app will not have functional messaging capabilities, it will provide a hands-on experience with RecyclerView and related UI components.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a chat application user interface using RecyclerView. You will learn how to display a list of chat messages, style them to look like a chat conversation, and handle various UI elements associated with a messaging app.
